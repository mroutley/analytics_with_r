Here are some basic instructions for setting up R and RStudio on Windows. Advanced options are included below for GitHub.

# Install R

1. Open <http://cran.rstudio.com/>, click the "Download R for Windows" link and then the "base" link
2. Download the R for Windows installer
3. Run the installer

# Install RStudio

1. Open <http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
2. Download the Zip/Tarballs archive for Windows XP (you can't run the installer without admin rights to your computer)
3. Right-click on the downloaded archive,  select "Extract all...", and extract the contents to an RStudio folder in your My Documents folder
4. Create a shortcut to the `bin/rstudio.exe` file by right-clicking on the file and choosing "Send to > Desktop"

# Optional - Install Swirl

Swirl provides a good, interactive introduction to R.

1. Open <http://swirlstats.com/students.html>
2. Follow the instructions, starting at step 3
3. Take at least the [R Programming](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses) course as an introduction to using R

# Advanced options

## Install Rtools

1. Open <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>
2. Download and install the most recent Rtools

## Install git

1. Open <https://windows.github.com/>
2. Download Github for Windows
3. Run the installer
4. Open the Github for Windows options menu (the gear icon in the top right) and set the Default shell to Git Bash 
5. Add the following lines to `~/.gitconfig`

```
[url "https://"]
	insteadof = git://
[http]
	proxy = http://192.168.x.x:3128 # Get the real proxy from IT
[https]
	proxy = http://192.168.x.x:3128 # Get the real proxy from IT
```

## Setup github

1. Create an account on <https://github.com/>
2. Create an [access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/)
	
## Configure RStudio

Save `.Rprofile` to `~/Documents` containing:

```R
library(httr)
set_config(use_proxy("192.168.x.x",3128)) # Get the real proxy from IT
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "######")
```

This sets RStudio to use the proxy server and your GitHub credentials.

Now open the Global Options list in RStudio and select the Git/SVN tab. For the Git executable, browse to: 

    C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_c2ba306e536fdf878271f7fe636a147ff37326ad\bin\git.exe
    
where `USERNAME` is your windows username.
